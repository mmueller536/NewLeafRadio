# You like animal crossing music
So do I. In fact, it is part of the human condition to love animal crossing music, even if you don't play the games! They are innately relaxing and cozy to listen to. Who needs ASMR, am I right?

# Hourly Animal Crossing Music, on the hour, every hour
Every hour, in game, the animal crossing music swaps to a new track. This helps track the passage of time and the change of mood as the day progresses. Well real life needs the same thing too! No reason we should be limited and shackled to the worlds of Animal Crossing to enjoy their cozy music!

# When it rains, it pours... out some awesome tunes!
Whenever the game decides that there should be precipitation, the track changes again to account for it. The pitter patter of rain and the delicate fall of snow are all part of the ambience and are included as part of the music to help capture and invoke the mood of rain falling at 6am or snowflake landing at the stroke of midnight. The app does just the same, but with an added twist: Its based on your weather! Not perfect of course, but for anyone within the United States you can enjoy the music adapting to your own weather on the hour! Should you wish to play god, you can also decide whenever each track plays, indepedent of any actual real world influence ( hint: Always play rain ;) )

# How do I install this project?
Just clone down the repo and run it like any other node project. Be careful to run that npm install command too! Should the art of Node for whatever be lost or you are new to running a Node project, the commands are:

npm install

(yup ez pz)
followed by...

node index.js

Make sure you are running these in the right directory too!

# Running apps locally is for losers, I want it now!
Don't fret, the project is hosted for free forever on http://newleafradio.glitch.me/. You may need to wake it up, but once it's up it will be dedicated to giving you your jimmie jams :)
