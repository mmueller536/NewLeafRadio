                                    is in thanks to the work by original composer Kazumi Totaka. For more information on contributions Kazumi has played in
                                    Animal Crossing as well as various other Nintendo intellectual products <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0869300/">click here</a>!

                                <p>
                                    Rather than rip the loopable tracks straight from the game, their mp3's were gathered from the youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JezDayy/videos">Jez</a> 
                                    run by JezDayy. Seriously check out their channel. Their work involves way more than just extending Animal Crossing audio and I've personally checked out their channel in
                                    the past for music to use for studying (especially the raining tracks).

                                <p>
                                    I plan to never feature their personal works here as I would hate to steal their work and rob them of 
                                    any monetization that comes from watching works that they have personally compiled/composed themselves. What will be here are just the extended tracks featured from their 
                                    channel.
